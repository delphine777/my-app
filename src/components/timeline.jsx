                        <p>I started my Master's Degree at UCLA, Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2017. I joined a research group from UCLA BioEngineering and started my project Dynamic Optical Contrast Imaging (DOCi) collaborated with UCLA Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. I published Dynamic Optical Contrast Imaging (DOCi): System Theory for Rapid, Wide-Field, Multispectral Optical Imaging Using Fluorescence Lifetime Contrast Mechanism as the second author and it was published on SPIE Medical Imaging in 2019.

                        I joined UCLA HCI Research in 2018 and started my project explainable AI. I focus on human-centered AI for medical professionals to help them understand the decision-making process of AI by interaction. I also published two conference papers at IUI workshop on Explainable Smart Systems (EXSS), 2019 and CHI 2020.
